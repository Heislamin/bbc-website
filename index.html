<h3>  BREAKING NEWS </h3>
<p><b> Fire Outbreak In California </b></p>
<p>It is the latest legal trouble for Pacific Gas & Electric, which has been blamed for a series of deadly wildfires in the state in recent years.
A judge found prosecutors had presented enough evidence during a preliminary hearing for the company to stand trial.
PG&E - the state's biggest utility provider - has pleaded not gulty.
The company is scheduled to appear at a hearing on 15 February when the judge is expected to set a trial date.
The charges include involuntary manslaughter and recklessly starting a fire. Twenty other charges were dismissed on Thursday.
The Zogg fire started in September 2020 in northern California and burned 88 sq miles (228 sq km) of land and more than 200 homes before it
 was eventually contained.
Those killed included an 8-year-old girl and her mother as they tried to drive away from their home.
An investigation revealed it began when a pine tree fell on power lines belonging to PG&E. The utility giant told the BBC that it recognised
 its equipment had caused the fire but denied criminal wrongdoing.
"We believe PG&E did not commit any crimes," it said. "We continue our work to make it safe and make it right, both by resolving claims 
from past fires and through our work to make our system safer every day."
PG&E filed for bankruptcy in 2019 after its faulty equipment sparked several fires in California, including the 2018 Camp Fire which killed
 84 people.
The company reached a $13.5bn (£11bn) settlement with the victims of that wildfire and several others in 2015, 2016 and 2017.</p><br>

<h3> HOW IT HAPPENED </h3>
<p>On the 13th of May, 2022, around 11:30 in the morning, a fire broke out in the Galaxy Mall at Sarojini Nagar,
Delhi. The entire area around the mall was covered with thick black smoke. Everyone from the mall was evacuated
before the fire engulfed a major portion of the mall. The manager of the mall had called the firefighters to put
out the fire. The locals tried to put out the fire but their efforts were of no use. Six fire-engines arrived
within 10 minutes and, for the next two hours, tried their best to put out the fire. Due to the presence of flammable
things like clothes, plastic, etc. in the mall, the fire spread quite fast. The people living near the mall were
asked to leave their houses to ensure that no civilians got injured. After struggling to put out the fire for two
hours, finally, the firefighters were able to bring the fire under control. Three of the firefighters were injured
during this operation, and they were taken to the nearest hospital. The Chief Minister, SDO, and Chief of firefighters
had also arrived at the site of the fire accident. Though the fire was finally put out after long hours of struggle,
most of the shops inside the mall were completely destroyed. The firefighters reported that the fire accident took
place at such a massive scale due to a short circuit and the absence of adequate fire safety equipment. The Chief
Minister issued a statement thanking the firefighters for their job and assuring to help the shopkeepers who had lost
their shops to restart their businesses.</p><br>

 <h3> Football regulator: UK government confirms new independent body </h3>
 <p>Blocking clubs from joining a breakaway European Super League will be among the powers held
 by English football's new independent regulator.
The plan for a regulator, recommended by a fan-led review last year, has been confirmed by the UK government.

Preventing historic clubs going out of business is one of the aims, as well as giving fans greater input
and a new owners' and directors' test.

The significant move aims to protect English football's cultural heritage.
<b>The main purposes of the proposed new regulator will be:</b>

Stopping English clubs from joining closed-shop competitions, which are judged to harm the domestic game
Preventing a repeat of financial failings seen at numerous clubs, notably the collapses of Bury and Macclesfield
Introducing a more stringent owners' and directors' test to protect clubs and fans
Giving fans power to stop owners changing a club's name, badge and traditional kit colours
Ensuring a fair distribution of money filters down the English football pyramid from the Premier League
"The English game remains one of the UK's greatest cultural exports, with clubs and leagues around the world
modelling themselves on its success," the government said before its white paper on football governance - a policy
document which outlines the proposed legislation - is released on Thursday.

"That is why the government is today taking the necessary and targeted steps to ensure that continues for generations."

The Premier League was understood to be wary of a regulatory body when the proposals were announced in April last year.

The league says it is "vital" a regulator does not lead to any "unintended consequences" that could affect its global appeal and success.

What will the regulator cover?
European breakaway leagues

Six English clubs - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham - were among a
dozen from across the continent that announced plans to form a European Super League in a shock move in April 2021.</p>

<h3> Oscars 2023: RRR's Naatu Naatu wins best original song </h3>
<center><button onclick="func()">FADE IMAGE</button></center>
<p>
The song Naatu Naatu from the hit Telugu-language film RRR has made history by becoming the first Indian film song to win an Oscar.
The blockbuster track won Best Original Song at the 95th Academy Awards, beating heavyweights like Lady Gaga and Rihanna.
Its catchy tempo and choreography has captivated audiences around the world.
India won a second Oscar for The Elephant Whisperers which won in the Best Documentary Short film category.
The documentary, which tells the story of a couple who care for an injured baby elephant after it gets separated from its herd,
is the first Indian production to bag a win in the category.
Shot in the picturesque Nilgiri mountains in southern India, The Elephant Whisperers explores the warm bond that develops between
 the human and animal as they begin to coexist.
However, India's big win remained Naatu Naatu, a thumping song that has got thousands grooving to its beats.
The song already made history in January when it won a Golden Globe for the best original song - a first for India. The same month,
 it also won the Critics' Choice award for the best song.
While accepting the Oscar, composer MM Keeravani said the song was "the pride of every Indian".
He said that he had grown up listening to songs by The Carpenters - an American music duo - and sang the rest of his speech in the
 tune of their hit song Top Of The World.
The audience burst into laughter and applause as he said that RRR had "put me on the top of the world".
A fictitious story about two legendary revolutionaries and their journey away from home before they started fighting for their country
 in the 1920s.During the British era, Malli, a small tribal girl, is taken away by British governor Scott Buxton and his wife Catherine
 against the wishes of her 
mother. Rama Raju is an Indian cop who works for the British army; for him duty comes first, and he is very ruthless to revolutionary
 Indians but is never given his due by British government. The British government find that a tribal Komaram Bheem, who considers 
 Malli his sister, has started his search for her and could be an obstacle for the British army. The governor and his wife announce
 a special post for any officer who can bring Bheem to them. Rama Raju decides to take the matters into his own hands and promises
 the government to bring him in dead or alive. Bheem by now has reached he city in search of Malli and pretends to be a mechanic, 
 Akhtar. During a train accident on a lake he and Rama Raju risk their lives and save a kid and become best of friends.
 But each man will clash with the other and will thirst for each other's blood in order to complete their missions.
—alex.mjacko@gmail.com
India, 1920. Determined to reunite Malli, an abducted Gond girl, with her mother, the tribe's fearless defender, 
Bheem, sets foot in vast Delhi using a new identity. But the British have the population under their thumb
. As a result, ruthless Governor Scott Buxton entrusts Rama Raju, a hard-as-nails police officer, with a vital task:
 work undercover to ferret out an unknown Gond warrior. And before long, Bheem and Raju have a chance encounter at 
 an accident site, and they immediately bond. However, as the two bosom friends embark on a peril-laden rescue
 mission in Delhi's bustling streets, utterly unaware of each other's true identity, pressing questions arise. 
 What happens if one of the mighty companions blows his cover? In the battle royal between fire and water, who would win?
—Nick Riganas
India, 1920. Due to the brutality of the British rulers, often unprovoked, callous and unnecessary,
 the Indian people are becoming restless and revolt is in the air. They need a leader and get one: 
 Komaram Bheem. Out to get him is another Indian, Rama Raju, a fearless policeman
 with undying loyalty to the British government.
